		<h1>The A.J.A.K. About Page</h1>
		<p><img src="images\hands.jpg" alt="Teamwork" align="right">Our mission at A.J.A.K.co is establishing personal projects 
		with vigor, enthusiasm and energy. We offer a unique design experience for everyone, by providing the 
		best custom sites and programs. At A.J.A.K we have dedication to the highest quality of custom sites 
		and programs delivered efficiently, precisely, and adaptively. A.J.A.K. values teamwork and 
		dedication to our craft. We plan our company will help change the world dramatically in 
		making it a better place.</p> 
		
		<h2>Our Name:</h2>
		<p>Where did our name come from? Well our C.E.O. took our founding member's first names of course! 
		Jacob (C.E.O.) Andrew, Julieth, Angela, and Kathryn are the original team and founding members of 
		A.J.A.K. Not to be confused with AJAX, which is a completely unrelated development set for web 
		applications.</p> 
		<p>We know what you're thinking,"Were they just incapable of coming up with their own name?" and 
		no, we are self proclamed narcissists who enjoy the first letter of our first names and wanted 
		to symbolize kinship in our company name by combining our name to represent ourselves in all 
		our glory as <b>one</b>.</p>

		<h2>Meet The Team:</h2>
		<b>Jacob Rothman:</b></br>
		<i>Chief Executive Officer</i></br><p></p>
		
		<b>Andrew Lee:</b></br>
		<i>Janitor</i></br>
		<p>Humble worker who chose to live the simple life. Rose from the ashes of the burnt documents accidentally 
		thrown away by an irresponsible employee with the sole purpose of cleaning up problems left by others. Tragic backstory [REDACTED].</p>
		
		<b>Julieth Jaramillo:</b>
		<i>Sr. Associate Junior Super Senior Programmer</i><br>
		<p>Animal and Nature enthusiast that decided to be Computer Science major 
		out of love for problem solving.</br></p>
		
		<b>Angela Kwok:</b></br>
		<i>Junior Snack Manager and Chief Staple Officer</i></br>
		<p> While typically a quiet and friendly individual, Angela is viewed with a health amount of respect
		by new employees and interns.  A stress baker and being responsible for providing snacks to the office, Angela
		has her own oven and stove in the break room.  Not long after the founding of the company an irresponsible 
		employee left some papers near her oven while she was baking muffins and they caught fire.  Rumour has it 
		that the employee in question disappeared and was never seen or heard from again.  While the police did bring
		Angela in for questioning under suspicion of being involved, nothing was ever confirmed and all related case
		files are sealed.</p>
		
		<b>Kathryn Cox:</b></br>
		<i>Paperclip Manager and Senior Animal Petter</i></br>
		<p>She self appointed herself as the official animal petter of the office. Once an intern brought 
		their corgi, Jingles, in and Kathryn was held up for the entire work hours petting little Jingles. #Truestory.
		Kathryn enjoys long walks on the beach and 8:00 AM Mimosas. Secretly, she has the interns do all
		the heavy paperclip lifting because she claims to have "noodle arms," C.E.O. Jacob is suspicious of Kathryn
		abusing her power over the interns.</p>

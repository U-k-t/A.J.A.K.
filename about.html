		<h1>The A.J.A.K. About Page</h1>
		<p><img src="images\hands.jpg" alt="Teamwork" align="right">Our mission at A.J.A.K.co is establishing personal projects 
		with vigor, enthusiasm and energy. We offer a unique design experience for everyone, by providing the 
		best custom sites and programs. At A.J.A.K we have dedication to the highest quality of custom sites 
		and programs delivered efficiently, precisely, and adaptively. A.J.A.K. values teamwork and 
		dedication to our craft. We plan our company will help change the world dramatically in 
		making it a better place.</p> 
		
		<h2>Our Name:</h2>
		<p>Where did our name come from? Well our C.E.O. took our founding member's first names of course! 
		Jacob (C.E.O.) Andrew, Julieth, Angela, and Kathryn are the original team and founding members of 
		A.J.A.K. Not to be confused with AJAX, which is a completely unrelated development set for web 
		applications.</p> 
		<p>We know what you're thinking,"Were they just incapable of coming up with their own name?" and 
		no, we are self proclamed narcissists who enjoy the first letter of our first names and wanted 
		to symbolize kinship in our company name by combining our name to represent ourselves in all 
		our glory as <b>one</b>.</p> 
        
        <h2> Our Story:</h2>
        <p>The A.J.A.K. Company founders came together one wonderfully drunken night and wanted to be 
        the change in the problems that they always complained about. Jacob's orginial plan was huge 
        and ambitious but ultimately his decisions, and the other founding members' influence led to a 
        happy accident known as the A.J.A.K. company. Now, we represent solidarity and commitment.

		<h2>Meet The Team:</h2>
        The team compromises of many wonderful-ish people. There are all kinds of departments that help keep the company
        running perfectly with absolutely no issues ever. These departments are lead by the founding members below.</br></br>
		<b>Jacob Rothman:</b></br><img src="images\Jacob.png" style="width:100px;" alt="Jacob Portrait" align="right">
		<i>Chief Executive Officer</i></br>
        <p>He made some of the wrong choices while on his path to world domination and ended up the CEO of a software
        contracting firm. Now he spends his days shirking the majority of his responsibilities and selling 
        trade secrets to A.J.A.K's competitors. Blindly approving contracts and discarding important 
        documents, he thinks his employees don't know, but many are on to his antics.</p>
		
		<b>Andrew Lee:</b></br><img src="images\Andrew.png" style="width:100px;" alt="Andrew Portrait" align="right">
		<i>Janitor</i></br>
		<p>Humble worker who chose to live the simple life as a Janitor. He rose from the ashes of suspiciously burnt 
        documents with the sole purpose of cleaning up problems. His duty reaches outside of cleaning as he corrects 
        bad contracts and deals that have been enacted by the work of an irresponsible employee. Tragic backstory [REDACTED].</p>
		
		<b>Julieth Jaramillo:</b></br>
		<i>Sr. Associate Junior Super Senior Programmer</i><br>
		<p>Animal and Nature enthusiast that decided to be Computer Science major 
		out of love for problem solving.</br></p>
		
		<b>Angela Kwok:</b></br><img src="images\Angela.jpg" style="width:100px;" alt="Angela Portrait" align="right">
		<i>Junior Snack Manager and Chief Staple Officer</i></br>
		<p> While typically a quiet and friendly individual, Angela is viewed with a healthy amount of respect
		by new employees and interns.  A stress baker and being responsible for providing snacks to the office, Angela
		has her own oven and stove in the break room.  Not long after the founding of the company an irresponsible 
		employee left some papers near her oven while she was baking muffins and they caught fire.  Rumour has it 
		that the employee in question disappeared and was never seen or heard from again.  While the police did bring
		Angela in for questioning under suspicion of being involved, nothing was ever confirmed and all related case
		files are sealed.</p>
		
		<b>Kathryn Cox:</b></br><img src="images\Kathryn.jpg" style="width:100px;" alt="Kathryn Portrait" align="right">
		<i>Paperclip Manager and Senior Animal Petter</i></br>
		<p>Because the power she held as a founding member, she self appointed herself as the official animal 
        petter of the office. Once an intern brought their corgi, Jingles, in and Kathryn was held up for 
        the entire work hours petting little Jingles. #Truestory. Kathryn enjoys long walks on the beach 
        and 8:00 AM Mimosas. Secretly, she has the interns do all the heavy paperclip lifting because 
        she claims to have "noodle arms," C.E.O. Jacob is suspicious of Kathryn abusing her power over 
        the interns.</p>
